This is command line hangman that gets a random word that contains between 5 and 12 letters from from the google-10000-english-no-swears.txt file.
You then have normal hangamn where you have to guess the word however at any point you can save the game.
You can then reaopen the game by typing in the file name.
The code is pretty self-explanitory if you dont understand what im saying.
